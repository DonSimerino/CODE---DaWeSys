## About CODE
CODE is a browser extension for the Chrome-Browser. It allows users to get a quick overview about the information website track before they even open the website. With small labels next to the search results in Google they can easily decide whether to open a website or not.

## Functionality
Let's summarize the core functionality features of the extension.

## Design
### Labels
CODE-Labels are designed to give users privacy information about websites real quick. With a **simple comprehensible design** users easily understand its meaning.

There are three labels: **green, yellow and red**. User will see the green one if the website is considered highly privacy sensitive and does not track their personal information. The yellow one appears, when there are some concerns about the website, which are not considered totally trustworthy. Lastly, there are red labels for websites, which are considered as not privacy sensitive or bare a risk for the user e.g. malicious software.

No matter which label appears, users always can **hover over the label** to see more information about it. Users will find the amount of trackers found on the page as well as some icons for the popular ones like the ones by Google or Facebook. This way users are more likely to understand how the label "got it color".

### Privacy Summary (Homepage / New Tab)
There are some design features on the Homepage which are worth mentioning. The Homepage appears on the New Tab in the browser and contains three main fields. The first and most present one is a number - **privacy score**. The privacy score summarizes the labels users've been using in a period of time e.g. one week. It counts the green labels among the visited websites and relates this number to labels from all visited labels. This way user can easily see how thier surfing behaviour was. For example: Assuming user sees a 75%. It means, that over all visited websites 75 percent had a green label. That's pretty awesome!

There are two more fields: an overview about recently calculated labels and a form to create a new label for a website. Both are used to **increase user interaction** with the extension. With creating new labels, users can easily calculate labels for websites they are most interested in. And with the history of recently created labels users can track the dynamic nature of the extension and easily have a brief look at the results.

Since the Homepage summarizes the core functionality of the extension and informs users about it, it is simply called: **Privacy Summary**.
